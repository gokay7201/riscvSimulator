# RISC-V Simulator
## Designing A Datapath Simulator for A RISC-V Architecture
The simulator gets a sequence of
RISC-V instructions as a text file and then perform a cycle accurate simulation. It should have
the ability to provide:
* CPI
* Total number of Clock Cycles
* Total Number of Stalls
* A list of instructions causing stalls and the corresponding number of stalls.
