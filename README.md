# Designing A Datapath Simulator for A RISC-V Architecture
 The simulator gets a sequence of
RISC-V instructions as a text file and then perform a cycle accurate simulation. It should have
the ability to provide: <\br>
1) CPI <\br>
2) Total number of Clock Cycles<\br>
3) total Number of Stalls<\br>
4) a list of Instructions causing stalls and the corresponding number of stalls.
